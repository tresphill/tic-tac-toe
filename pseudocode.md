# understanding the problem
its a simple game of tic tac toe
it will need:
    - a symbol for x
    - a symbol for o
    - an indicator for whose turn it is (player1, player2)
    - a gameboard (9 square divs representing the grid)
    - an indicator for who won
    - a restart game function

# functions
trying to hit the goal of minimal to no html
all divs should be created in js using createElement
querySelector to call to my html??
how would i save this in state??
an array of strings for each 'cell' 
a way to index those arrays
click handlers to render move selection x or o
    -remove event listeners once cell is filled??
list of winning arrays?? (8 in total)
innerText to render whose turn it is??
